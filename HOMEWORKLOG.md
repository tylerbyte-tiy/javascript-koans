-- Don't freak out until you've completed all the requirements within curly braces

-- So what exactly does shift do? The last exercise in the Array section. Why does 3 give me 1,2?

-- Lexical? (Lexical scoping to synthesize functions) I half understand this problem. 10+3+5+5=23. I'm not sure if I could duplicate it

-- Why does John rule? I haven't connected all the dots yet. In Functions

about inheritance -- the swedishChef thing is very confusing. Too many arrows pointing to other declarations
